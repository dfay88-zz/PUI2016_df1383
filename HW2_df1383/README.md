Assignment 2 required accessing the MTA API and then printing and creating a csv file with bus information obtained from the API.
The next part of the assignment required reading a CSV file from the CUSP Data Hub and plotting the results. 
I worked with Avikal and Victor for the assignments. Avikal helped me with writing the code to input N/A for bus information that was not available.
