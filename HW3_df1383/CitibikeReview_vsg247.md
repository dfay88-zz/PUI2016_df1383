### a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses

The formulation of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses was correct, very clear and understandable.


### b. Verify that the data supports the project 

The data preparation was very thorough. Outliers were taken good care of and the visualizations of the dataset were clear and
helpful. Besides that, the dataset has all the informaion needed in order to perform the intended analysis.

Since the goal is to see if there is a significant difference between two groups in a variable of interest (Trip Time), 
the most suitable analysis to perform would be a t-Test.
