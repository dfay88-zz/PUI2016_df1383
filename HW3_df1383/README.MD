Homework 3 involved visualizing and analyzing different distributions to prove the central limit theore as well as performing a hypothesis test on citibke data.  
  
I worked with Kristi on more clearly understanding the definition of the central limit theorem and plotting the 5 distributions. Avikal and I discussed the meaning of p-values and z scores.
