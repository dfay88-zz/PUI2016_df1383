# Homework 6
-----------------
## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 required us to download and merge building and energy data. We then use regression to build linear and 
polynomial models in order to try to predict energy consumption using number of units in the building. We compare these models using chi squared tests as well as a likelihood ratio test. I worked with Avikal, Geoff and Ben for this assignment.

## Assignment 2

Assignment 2 required us to finish our hypothesis test for the citibike mini project. Additionally, we needed to write a short summary of results and post it on Authorea. I collabarated with Victor and Avikal on questions for our respective tests but we eached performed invdividual mini projects.
