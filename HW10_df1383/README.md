### Assignment 1

Assignment 1 required us to follow along with Dr. Kashuk while he went through his notebook and explained geopandas and geospatial analytic techniques.

### Assignment 2
Assignment 2 required us to seperate the CitiBike ridership data into summer and winter months and then perform the same geospatial analysis as Dr. Kashuk performed during the lab.
Summer months were assumed to be June, July, August and winter months were assumed to be Decemeber, January, February.

#### Comparison of Winter and Summer
Both winter and summer months show similar spatial patterns. Both have a positive spatial relationship, which indicates that the surrounding area of each census track shows similar CitiBike ridership. Areas with high ridership are spatially close together and areas with low ridership are spatially closer together. The I statistics for winter and summer are .6599 and .6435, respectively. The slight difference in the I statistics is negligible and thus while total ridership decreases in the winter, the spatial correlation remains approximately the same over the course of the year.
