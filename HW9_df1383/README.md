### Assignment 1

Assignment 1 required us to investigate mta ridership data. The first task involved detecting an event (hurricane sandy) by identifying weeks that the ridership differed from the mean by 3 standard deviations. Task 2 we had to identify the card types which had a strong positive or negative trend over the date range. Task 3 required us to perform a fourier transformation on each station in order to identify the 4 stations with the most prominent annual periodicity. 

I worked with Krisi, Geoff, Jonathan Pichot, Avikal and Ben on this assignment.
