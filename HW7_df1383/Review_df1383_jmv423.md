##### Figure 1: Bar plot of the percentage of individuals who use cocaine in a given age group as well as a line plot of the frequency of use in each age group. Frequency of use is defined as the average number of times in a year the individuals in each age group use cocaine. Most notably, the plot illustrates the inverse relationship that as people get older they tend to use less cocaine however the indivdiuals who do use cocaine use it very frequently. Particularly the people betweent the ages of 50-64 who use it on average 36 times a year.

### Clarity
1. The plot is very easy to read, especially considering the amount of information that is being conveyed. 
2. Coloring the axes to match the bars & lines makes the differing scales intuitive.  
3. Good work defining the frequency of cocaine use in the caption.
4. The title could better explain the gist of the plot (eg., 'Cocaine Use by Age).
5. If possible, having simple tick marks on the y-axis would improve clarity. 

The takeaways I got from the plot are: (1) experimenting with cocaine peaks at 21, (2) the change in use for people over age 35 suggests a shift from experimentation to dependence, and (3) the amount of non-dependent users is larger than typically assumed.

### Aesthetic
I'm guessing you originially made the figure interactive using plotly, but it wouldn't draw on Github? I imagine the plotly version was only more aesthetically pleasing--very neat.

Based on the .png:

1. As above, the colored axes are great.
2. Keeping the plot simple instead of having a mess of horizontal lines is nice.
3. Consider putting the legend in the figure. Could fill in the white space in the upper left. 
4. The bin labels would be more distinguishable if they were on an angle.

### Honesty
1. The binning should be consistent, with the only exceptions at the tails (ie, <16 or 64<). I doubt this would change the takeaways from your plot.

### Conclusion
Clean plot that successfully conveys an interesting take on cocaine use. The simplicity of the plot enables you to convey a lot of information effectively. Only a few minor changes, as listed above, seem worthwhile.
