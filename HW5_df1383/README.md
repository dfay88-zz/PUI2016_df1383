# Homework 5

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 required us to test the distribution of citibike rider's ages to a normal distribution and another distribution of our choice using two seperate tests. I worked alone on this assignment.

## Assignment 2

Assignment 2 required us to compare men's income compared to women's income using linear regression analysis. We performed the regression the analysis on both median income and all income for men and women. I worked with chris streich and avikal for this assignment.

## Assignment 3

Assignment 3 required us to form a null and alternative hypothesis for several different proposed questions. I worked with avikal on this assignment.


-----------------------

### Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

#### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
#### Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null Hypothsis: People who only diet have higher or have equilavent body fat percentage loss on average than people who only exercise.

Alternative Hypothesis: People who only diet lose more body fat percentage loss on average than people who only exercise.

Formula:

H_0: The average body fat percentage loss of people who only diet

H_1: The average body fat percentage loss of people who only exercise

Null: H_0 >= H_1

Alternative: H_0 < H_1

#### Do American trust the president?
#### POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null Hypothsis: The percentage of voters who believe Bill Clinton is honest and trust worthy is greater than or equal to the number of voters who do not believe that.

Alternative Hypothesis: The percentage of voters who believe Bill Clinton is honest and trust worthy is less than the number of voters who do not believe that.

Formula:

H_0: Percentage of voters who believe Bill clinton is honest and trustworthy

H_1: Percentage of voters who believe Bill clinton is not honest and un-trustworthy

Null: H_0 >= H_1

Alternative: H_0 < H_1

#### Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
#### Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null Hypothsis: The cessation rate for smokers who use a nicotine patch is less than or equal to the cessation rate of people smokers who use a placebo patch.

Alternative Hypothesis: The cessation rate for smokers who use a nicotine patch is greater than the cessation rate of people smokers who use a placebo patch.

Formula:

H_0: Cessation of somkers who use a nicotine patch

H_1: Cessation of somkers who use a placebo patch

Null: H_0 <= H_1

Alternative: H_0 > H_1

#### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
#### Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null Hypothsis: The average IQ of children whose mother smoked during pregnancy is greater than or equal to the average IQ of children whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy. 

Alternative Hypothesis: The average IQ of children whose mother smoked during pregnancy less than the average IQ of children whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy. 

Formula:

H_0: Average IQ of children whose mother smoked during pregnancy

H_1: Average IQ of children whose mother did not smoked during pregnancy

Null: H_0 >= H_1

Alternative: H_0 < H_1
